# 🎧 YouTube Listen Mode Chrome Extension

A lightweight Chrome extension that turns any YouTube video into **audio‑only mode**. It adds a small headphones button to the YouTube player controls. When activated, the video element is hidden while the audio keeps playing, saving bandwidth and reducing visual distraction.

Google Store's extension: [TBD](#)
